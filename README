- Rack::MockRequest helps testing your Rack application without actually using HTTP.
           http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/Rack/MockRequest.html

- Rack::MockResponse provides useful helpers for testing your apps
           http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/Rack/MockResponse.html

Let and let!

  Use let to define a memoized helper method. The value will be cached
  across multiple calls in the same example but not across examples.

  Note that let is lazy-evaluated: it is not evaluated until the first time
  the method it defines is invoked. You can use let! to force the method's
  invocation before each example.

    let(:server) { Rack::MockRequest.new(Rsack::Server.new) }

  is conceptually equivalent to:

    def server
      Rack::MockRequest.new(Rsack::Server.new) 
    end

  only that is memoized
